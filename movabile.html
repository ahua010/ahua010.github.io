          <h3>problem space</h3>
          <p class="paragraph">In 2012, the Census Bureau reported that nearly 1 in 5 Americans have a disability (<a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html" target="_blank" class="link">source</a>). With more than 46,000 active enrolled students and 22,000 faculties and staffs on campus, the University of Washington also houses a large number of people with disability. Having been built in 1861, 39 year prior to the American Disability Act was signed into law, the campus still has several buildings and pathways that do not meet accessibility standards. Moreover, the information on accessible pathways and entrances were outdated and difficult to access. This creates obstacles for people with limited mobility when they navigate through campus.</p>

      <p>My group of 3 conceptualized and designed a map application that would provide users with accessibility information. It also lets users contribute and report obstacles to help other users in the community. </p>

        <p>We conducted literature review and web research to gain abetter understanding on the topic of mobility and accessibility.  These were the areas that we focused our research efforts on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Research context of mobility impairments and their specific needs when navigating in the community</li>
          <li>Research the American with Disabilities Act for guideline about public access</li>

            <p>Sindy is an undergraduate student at the University of Washington. She  became mobility-impaired 2 years ago. She is able to use forearm crutches to walk short distance. While being fairly mobile, her strength is limited and she has difficulty climbing stairs. She also tries to avoid slippery areas and pathways with steep slopes.<br>Sindy uses her phone very often to find directions and maps to locations on campus. However she can&#x27;t tell how long it would take to get somewhere because of her slower speed. <br>She use school’s shuttle service to go to classes and events, but she usually has to skip out on things that happen last minute. She wants to be more independent in planning her day.</p>

            <p>Most of Michael&#x27;s class are at Denny Hall, which is located uphill. He gets very tired and flustered after wheeling himself up. </p>
            <p>Michael commutes to work with a adaptive van. It is big so he needs to park in van accessible spots. They are difficult to find due to limited numbers and heavy traffic on campus. During rainy season, Michael wants to find a van-accessible parking spot as close to his class as possible.</p>

        <p>We received the following feedback, and used them to generate design recommendations:</p>
        <p>1. Participants confused accessibility icon and logo as clickable buttons</p>
        <p><strong>Design Recommendation:</strong> Update design to create clearer distinction between clickable and unclickable elements</p>
        <p>2. When searching for parking, participants wanted to know their current location in regard to the parking lot location</p>
        <p><strong>Design Recommendation:</strong> Add current location </p>
        <p>3. When informed of possible obstacles in their path, participants would like to have alternative routes suggested</p>
        <p><strong>Design Recommendation:</strong> Add option to reroute once obstacle is encountered on a path</p>

        <p>This project was the first of many projects that I took part in following the Goal-Directed Design process so it held a special place in my heart. It was very interesting exploring the concept of designing for accessibility and how to assist people with different ability.</p>
        <p>Due to the limited scope and timeframe, we did not dive in-depthinto user research to gather goals and needs from our targeted population.Moving forward, I would like to have the opportunity to explore more accessible features to improve the usability and to better cater to our targeted demographic. Some examples include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rating and Feedback:</strong> Give user the ability to rate and provide feedback about the level of accessibility of a path, building, or parking lot. Data collected would be sent to UW&#x27;s administrative to improve campus&#x27; accessibility.</li>
          <li><strong> Voice Command and Directions:</strong> Give user the option to keep their hands free. This is especially important for manual wheelchairs/walkers/crutches users.</li>
